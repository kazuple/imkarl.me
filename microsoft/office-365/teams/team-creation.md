# Organization-wide team
The following account types won't be added to your org-wide team:

- Accounts that are blocked from sign-in
- Guest users
- Service accounts
- Room or equipment accounts
- Accounts backed by a shared mailbox

## Best practices for creating an organization-wide team

To get the most benefit out of your org-wide team, team owners should follow these best practices:

- Allow only team owners to post to the General channel, to reduce channel “noise.”
- Turn off @team and @[team name] mentions to prevent overloading the entire organization.
- Automatically mark important channels as favorites to ensure that everyone in your organization engages in specific conversations.
- Set up channel moderation so that moderators can control who can start a new post in a channel, add and remove moderators, control whether team members can reply to existing channel messages, and control whether bots and connectors can submit channel messages.
- Remove accounts that might not belong. Make sure that you use Teams to remove users from your org-wide team. If you remove a user some other way, such as the Microsoft 365 admin center or from a group in Outlook, the user might be inadvertently added back to the org-wide team.
