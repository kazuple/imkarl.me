During the rest of 2020 the following features are planed for release:

- **Large meetings**: Meeting organizers will be able to schedule Teams meetings with up to 1,000 interactive participants instead of the normal 300 limit.
- **View-only overflow**: In addition to the 1,000 interactive participants, Teams meetings will be able to overflow to include an extra 20,000 participants in a “view-only meeting experience.” Vew-only users won’t be able to speak during the meeting but should have access to chat, like participants in Live Events.
- **Custom branded meeting lobby**: Admins will now be able to add a customer logo to the Teams experience, for display in the lobby and meeting pre-join experience. The logo will be displayed for meetings where the organizer has the Advanced Comms SKU.
