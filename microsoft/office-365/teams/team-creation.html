<h1>Organization-wide team</h1>
<p>The following account types won't be added to your org-wide team:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Accounts that are blocked from sign-in</li>
  <li>Guest users</li>
  <li>Service accounts</li>
  <li>Room or equipment accounts</li>
  <li>Accounts backed by a shared mailbox</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best practices for creating an organization-wide team</h2>
<p>To get the most benefit out of your org-wide team, team owners should follow these best practices:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Allow only team owners to post to the General channel, to reduce channel “noise.”</li>
  <li>Turn off @team and @[team name] mentions to prevent overloading the entire organization.</li>
  <li>Automatically mark important channels as favorites to ensure that everyone in your organization engages in specific conversations.</li>
  <li>Set up channel moderation so that moderators can control who can start a new post in a channel, add and remove moderators, control whether team members can reply to existing channel messages, and control whether bots and connectors can submit channel messages.</li>
  <li>Remove accounts that might not belong. Make sure that you use Teams to remove users from your org-wide team. If you remove a user some other way, such as the Microsoft 365 admin center or from a group in Outlook, the user might be inadvertently added back to the org-wide team.</li>
</ul>
