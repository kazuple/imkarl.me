# Definitions
### Emergency address
- A civic address—the physical or street address of a place of business for your organization.
- Used to route emergency calls to the appropriate dispatch authorities and to assist in locating the emergency caller.

### Place
- Place is associated with an emergency address to give a more exact location within a building.

### Emergency location
- A location is a civic address—with an optional place. If your business has more than one physical location, it's likely that you'll need more than one emergency location.
- When you create an emergency address, a unique location ID is automatically created for this address. 

### Registered address
- An emergency address that is assigned to each Calling Plan user; it is sometimes referred to as a static emergency address or address of record. (Registered addresses do not apply to Direct Routing users.)
