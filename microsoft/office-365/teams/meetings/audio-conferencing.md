# Key Points
- Audio Conferencing allows up to 250 phone attendees.
- Toll-free phone numbers (service numbers) are available but only in some countries/regions.

## Toll Free
A toll-free telephone number or freephone number is a telephone number that is billed for all arriving calls instead of incurring charges to the originating telephone subscriber. For the calling party, a call to a toll-free number from a landline is free of charge.

# Dial-out from meetings policies for Audio Conferencing
Outbound call controls can be applied on a per-user basis and provide the following two controls to independently restrict each type of outbound calls. By default, both controls are set to allow international and domestic outbound calls.
